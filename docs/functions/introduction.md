# Understanding Celest Functions

Celest Functions enable you to run custom business logic in the cloud, all in Dart, with no additional tooling. With Celest, you can connect to your tools or existing backend resources to retrieve and communicate data to create the experience needed for your Flutter app. 

## Why would I want to use Celest Functions?

Running functions in the cloud provides you with a separation layer between your business logic in the cloud, and the UI of your Flutter app. This also enables you to add features to your cloud functions while reducing the need to deploy a new version of your app to the app stores.
