# Introduction 

Celest functions enable you to run custom business logic in the cloud, all in Dart, with no additional tooling.

Running functions in the cloud provides you with a separation layer between your business logic in the cloud, and the UI of your Flutter app. 

Not only does this make your code more organized, but you can add features to your cloud functions (as long as they don't impact your request/response contract) without needing a new version to deploy to the app stores.
