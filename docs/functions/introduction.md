# Understanding Celest Functions

Celest Functions are "Cloud Widgets" that enable you to run custom business logic in your backend, all in Dart, with no additional tooling. With Celest Functions, you are able to use your existing data sources to create the experiences needed for your Flutter app. 

## Why would I want to use Celest Functions?

Celest Functions enable you to integrate with your existing tools or data sources and serve that information to your Flutter app. Additionally, running Celest Functions in the cloud provides you with a separation layer between your business logic, and the UI of your Flutter app. This enables you to add features to your Celest Functions, without needing a new version deployed to the app store.

## Next steps

You now have an understanding of the use cases that Celest Functions enable! You can follow our next guide to start [building your first Celest Function](/docs/functions/creating-functions.md).
