## What is Celest?
Celest is a fully managed cloud platform that enables you to build your backend in Dart. You can build the use cases you need without needing additional tooling, and share logic and code between your Flutter app and your backend.

## How do I use Celest?
You use Celest by downloading the CLI to start a new project. Then, the CLI creates a Celest folder for you in your Flutter project to start writing your backend in Dart. You can then use the Celest CLI to build your project locally and test it, and once you are ready, you can deploy your backend and have it be completely managed by Celest.

## What can I build with Celest?
At a high level, the following are the features that are available for you to build with Celest.
