# Celest Cloud

Celest Cloud is our hosting platform that allows you to deploy Celest projects to a managed cloud environment
with a single command. 

When you deploy your project to Celest Cloud, your backend run inside Google's Kubernetes Engine, which provides 
a secure and performant environment for your backend to grow. Celest handles the scaling, monitoring, and maintenance
of your backend so you can focus on building your app.

## Deploying a project

If you haven't already, start by [installing](/docs/download) the Celest CLI so that you can follow along.

To deploy to the cloud, navigate to your project folder and run `celest deploy`. The CLI will
build your project, upload it to the cloud, and start running it in a secure environment. At the end, your 
client will be updated with the new backend URL and you can immediately start using your new backend.
