# Supabase Auth

If you're migrating to Celest from another framework, chances are you already have a user base that you'd like to use.

As of Celest V1, Supabase can be used as your auth provider in Celest. And doing so is just as easy as with Celest's built-in auth.

## In your Celest project

To use Supabase as your auth provider, add the following code to your `project.dart` file:

```dart copy filename="celest/lib/src/project.dart"
import 'package:celest/celest.dart';

const project = Project(name: 'supabase');

const auth = Auth(
  providers: [
    ExternalAuthProvider.supabase(),
  ],
);
```

Verifying users with Supabase requires knowing your Supabase project's URL. When you run `celest start`, Celest will automatically search your environment for
any available Supabase projects. If it can't figure out which project to use, you'll be prompted to enter it manually. 

Celest will securely store your Supabase project URL for future use so it doesn't need to prompt you again.

## In your Flutter app

In your Flutter app, Celest will listen for changes to Supabase's auth state and update the Celest state accordingly so that 
calls to your Cloud Functions are authenticated appropriately.

To do so, it needs access to your Supabase client, which you pass into the `celest.init` call in your `main` function.

```dart copy filename="lib/main.dart"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:my_project_client/my_project_client.dart';
import 'package:supabase_flutter/supabase_flutter.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final supabase = await Supabase.initialize(
    url: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_URL',
    anonKey: 'YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY',
  );
  celest.init(
    externalAuth: ExternalAuth.supabase(supabase.client.auth),
  );
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```
