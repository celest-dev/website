# Celest Auth

Adding Auth to your Celest project takes 5 lines of code. In your `project.dart` file, add the following code:

```dart {5-9} copy filename="celest/lib/src/project.dart"
import 'package:celest/celest.dart';

const project = Project(name: 'my-project');

const auth = Auth(
  providers: [
    AuthProvider.email(),
  ],
);
```

That's it! When you run `celest start`, Celest will automatically integrate our open-source Auth backend 
[Cloud Auth](https://github.com/celest-dev/celest/tree/main/services/celest_cloud_auth) and generate an Auth 
client for you to use in your Flutter app.
