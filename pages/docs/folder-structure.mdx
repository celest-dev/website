# Folder structure

Every Celest project uses a standard folder structure for defining the different parts of your backend.

```shell
my_project/
└── celest/
    ├── pubspec.yaml                      # (1) Dependencies for your backend
    │
    ├── client/                           # (2) Generated Dart client
    │   ├── pubspec.yaml
    │   └── my_project_client.dart
    │
    └── lib/src/                          # (3) Your backend code           
        │── project.dart                  # (4) Project configuration
        └── functions/                    # (5) Cloud functions
            └── orders_api.dart
            └── shipping_api.dart
```

The folder structure should look very familiar. The `celest/` directory is just a Dart package, and the `lib/src/` directory is 
where you will define all of your backend logic. Of note:

- (1) The `pubspec.yaml` file in the `celest/` directory is where you define your dependencies for your backend.
      These dependencies are separate from both your generated client's dependencies and your Flutter project's dependencies.

- (2) The `client/` directory is where the Dart client is generated. This client is used to interact with your backend from your 
      Dart or Flutter app. As the client is generated by the CLI, you should not modify it directly.

- (3) The `lib/src/` directory is where you define your backend logic. This is where you will define your cloud functions,
      data models, and any other backend logic.

- (4) The `project.dart` file is where you define your project configuration. This file is where you define your project name, 
      and any other project-wide configuration. Any project-level configuration must be placed in this file.

- (5) The `functions/` directory is where you define your cloud functions. Each file in this directory groups and organizes multiple
      Celest Functions of similar functionality into a namespace called an API.

      All of your Cloud Functions must be defined in the `lib/src/functions` folder for Celest to recognize them.

Outside of the `project.dart` and `functions/` directories, you can create any other directories and files you need to organize your 
backend logic however you like.
