# Celest Functions

Celest Functions are the primary Cloud Widget that enable you to run custom business logic in your backend. They run as serverless functions in the cloud, and are triggered by HTTP requests.

## Why would I want to use Celest Functions?

Celest Functions enable you to:
- Integrate your existing tools or data sources and serve that information to your app.
- Create a separation layer between your business logic, and the UI of your app. 
- Add features to your backend without needing a new version deployed to the app stores.
