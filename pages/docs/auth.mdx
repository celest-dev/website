# Celest Auth

Celest currently supports email-based authentication via one-time passcodes. This is a simple and secure way to authenticate users in your app without needing to worry about passwords.

<Callout>
We are working on adding social sign-in and passkeys in future releases. If you have a specific use case you'd like to see, please let us know by creating an [issue](https://github.com/celest-dev/celest/issues/new/choose).
</Callout>

Adding Auth to your Celest project takes 5 lines of code. In your `project.dart` file, add the following code:

```dart copy filename="celest/project.dart"
import 'package:celest/celest.dart';

const project = /* .. */;

const auth = Auth(
  providers: [
    AuthProvider.email(),
  ],
);
```

That's it! When you run `celest start`, Celest will automatically generate an Auth client for you to use in your Flutter app.

## Signing In

To sign in a user, you can use the `authenticate` method on the `celest.auth` object. It's called `authenticate` because there is no longer a distinction between signing in or signing up! 
If the user doesn't exist, they will be created.

```dart
final flow = await celest.auth.email.authenticate(
  email: 'dillon@celest.dev',
);

// Prompt user for OTP code sent to the email

final user = await flow.verify(otpCode: '123456');
print('User signed in: ${user.id}');
```

A full example of a typical auth flow can be found in our [repo](https://github.com/celest-dev/celest/tree/main/packages/celest_auth/example).

## Authorizing your functions

Once a user is signed in, they can access functions marked `@authenticated`. To learn more about authorizing your functions, check out [Authorizing functions](/docs/functions/authorizing-functions).
