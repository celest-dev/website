# Auth

Celest comes with built-in auth support via our [Cloud Auth](https://github.com/celest-dev/celest/tree/main/services/celest_cloud_auth) package: an open-source, Dart-native service for
authenticating and authorizing users in any Dart backend.

</div>

Cloud Auth is built on top of the [Cedar](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/en) policy engine and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) to both manage user accounts 
and enforce consistent access controls in a single Dart package. The Celest CLI will automatically integrate Cloud Auth into your project when 
using Celest Auth, but the service is exposed as a Shelf router and middleware which can be used in any Dart project.

> Celest Auth also suppors integrating [Supabase](./auth/supabase-auth.mdx) and [Firebase](./auth/firebase-auth.mdx) for cases where you 
> already have an existing user base.
