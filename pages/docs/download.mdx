# Download Celest

You can download the Celest CLI by running the following command:

<div className="flex flex-col items-center space-y-4 my-4">
    <DownloadButton />
</div>

This will install the Celest CLI globally on your system, allowing you to use it from any directory.

<Callout type="info">
  To ensure that the Celest CLI is available in your PATH, you may need to add the Dart SDK's pub cache to your PATH.

  On macOS and Linux, you can do this by adding the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`):

  ```bash
  export PATH="$PATH":"$HOME/.pub-cache/bin"
  ```

  On Windows, you can add the following location to your PATH environment variable:

  ```
  %LOCALAPPDATA%\Pub\Cache\bin
  ```
</Callout>
