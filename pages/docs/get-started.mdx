# Getting started

This guide walks you through setting up Celest on your development machine, and how to create a new project.


## Prerequisites
To use Celest in your Flutter app, you need the following prerequisites:

1. Install [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
2. Create a new Flutter project (or navigate to an existing one)
3. [Download](/docs/download) and install the Celest CLI

That's it! You are now ready to start building your backend - all in Dart!

## Starting a new Celest project

Start by first creating a new Flutter project. If you have an existing Flutter project, you can use that instead. To start a new Flutter project, go to your console and run the following command.

```shell
$ flutter create my_celest_app
```

Then, navigate to your new Flutter app.

```shell
$ cd my_celest_app
```

Once you are in your Flutter app directory, run the following command to initialize your Celest project.

```shell    
$ celest start
```

Once the project is generated, Celest will continue to run in the terminal. A local development environment is spun up as the CLI watches for changes made to your backend, hot-reloading your changes and code-generating
a client library automatically.

Your backend lives in the generated `celest` folder. Every `celest` folder follows this structure, which helps to keep your backend organized.

```shell
my_celest_app/
└── celest/
    ├── functions/                        # Celest Functions folder
    |   └── greeting.dart                 # Example API file
    ├── lib/
    │   │── client.dart                   # Generated client for your Flutter app
    │   ├── models/                       # Custom API models
    |   |   └── person.dart
    │   └── exceptions/                   # Custom API exceptions
    |       └── bad_name_exception.dart
    └── test/                             # Tests for your backend
```
