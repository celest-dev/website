# Self-Hosting

As of Celest V1, all Celest projects can be self-hosted on any server that can run a Docker container. This means you can deploy your Celest project 
to any cloud provider, on-premises server, or even your own computer.

Self-hosting support is provided via the `celest build` command which will bundle all of the dependencies of your Celest project into a 
lightweight Docker container. The container will be pre-configured with all the necessary environment variables and settings to run your 
Celest project.
