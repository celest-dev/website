# Defining custom data types

With Celest Functions, you can use any of the core Dart types available such as `int`, `String`, and `DateTime`. You can also use your custom data types. Celest will handle the transfer and formatting of data from your Flutter app to your backend, also known as serialization, out-of-the-box in most cases. In situations requiring custom serialization, you can write your logic which will be used instead.

<Callout type="info">
Celest does not support the following Dart types as parameter or return types, or as a field of a parameter or return type: 
`Stream`, `Object`, `dynamic`

To represent raw JSON types, use the `JsonValue` type from `package:celest` instead of `Object?` or `dynamic`.
</Callout>

# Custom data type example

Imagine you're working on an e-commerce application with an `Order` class defined in your codebase. To have Celest use that custom class, you need to place it in the `<flutter_app>/celest/lib/models/` folder.

```dart filename="celest/lib/models/order.dart"
class Order {
  const Order ({
    required this.id,
    required this.customerName,
    required this.price,
  });

  final int id;
  final String customerName;
  final Price price;
}

enum Currency { usd, cad, ... }

class Price {
  const Price({
    required this.currency,
    required this.dollars,
    required this.cents,
  }): assert(cents < 100);

  final Currency currency;
  final int dollars;
  final int cents;
}
```

Use this `Order` type in any Celest Function as either a parameter or return value, without adding serialization logic.

```dart {1,5} filename="celest/functions/orders.dart"
import 'package:celest_backend/models/order.dart';

@cloud
Future<String> createOrder(
  Order customerOrder,
) async {
  // Function logic goes here
}
```

When communicating with your backend, Celest will serialize the `Order` class as a JSON map with the field names as keys. The resulting information transferred over to your backend will have the following shape.

```json
{
  "customerOrder": {
    "id": 123,
    "customerName": "Celest",
    "price": {
      "currency": "usd",
      "dollars": 100,
      "cents": 34
    }
  }
}
```


## Writing custom serialization logic

If you need custom handling for your serialization logic, add the `fromJson` and `toJson` methods to your data type. Celest will use your custom `fromJson`/`toJson` implementations when transmitting the type to and from your backend.

Here, the `Price.toJson` method is used to upper-case the `currency` value.

```dart {8-12} filename="celest/lib/models/order.dart"
class Price {
  // ...

  factory Price.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    // ...
  }

  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => {
      'currency': currency.name.toUpperCase(),
      'dollars': dollars,
      'cents': cents,
    };
}
```

The resulting JSON response for the `currency` will now be returned as upper case.

 ```diff {6,7}
{
  "customerOrder": {
    "id": 123,
    "customerName": "Celest",
    "price": {
+    "currency": "USD",
-    "currency": "usd",
      "dollars": 100,
      "cents": 34
    }
  }
}
```

### Customize serialization of third-party types [#custom-overrides]

Sometimes, though, you cannot control the `fromJson`/`toJson` methods of a class, such as when using a third-party library. 
In these cases, you can create a `@customOverride` which "redefines" the type for serialization in Celest.

For example, consider the case where the `Price` class from our `Order` type is imported from a third-party library, `package:price`. 
Since we do not own `package:price`, we cannot change the `fromJson` and `toJson` methods of the `Price` class.

Instead of modifying the `Price` class, we can define a custom override for `Price` which will be used in place of the original
`Price` class when it's encountered in Celest.

<Callout>
Custom overrides are defined as [extension types](https://dart.dev/language/extension-types) which wrap and implement the original type. 
You can use these to override any part of the original interface to suit its use in your backend, though customizing serialization is the 
most common use case.

You must always **implement** the original type in your extension type and mark it with `@customOverride`. By convention, these types are
defined in either `lib/models/_overrides.dart` or `lib/exceptions/_overrides.dart` and are not used directly in your backend. They serve as
global marker types which Celest will use internally.
</Callout>

```dart {10-11} filename="celest/lib/models/_overrides.dart"
import 'package:celest/celest.dart';
import 'package:price/price.dart';

// We create an extension type which wraps over the third-party type and
// is marked as a custom override of it.
//
// Since the extension type implements the original type, it will behave
// identically to the original except for the serialization logic we
// define in the `fromJson` and `toJson` methods.
@customOverride
extension type PriceOverride(Price price) implements Price {
  factory PriceOverride.fromJson(Map<String, Object?> json) {
    return PriceOverride(
      Price(
        currency: Currency.values.firstWhere(
          (e) => e.toString().toUpperCase() == json['currency'],
        ),
        dollars: json['dollars'] as int,
        cents: json['cents'] as int,
      ),
    );
  }

  Map<String, Object?> toJson() => {
        'currency': price.currency.toString().toUpperCase(),
        'dollars': price.dollars,
        'cents': price.cents,
      };
}
```
