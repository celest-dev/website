# Defining your data types

With Celest Functions, you can use any of the core Dart types available such as `int`, `String`, and `DateTime`. 
You can also use your own data types. Celest will automatically handle the transfer of data to and from your Flutter app 
(a process known as serialization) so you don't need to think about it. 

> If you'd prefer to handle the serialization yourself, Celest will use your [custom logic](./customizing-serialization.mdx) instead.

Imagine you're working on an e-commerce application with an `Order` class defined in your codebase.

```dart filename="celest/lib/src/models/order.dart"
class Order {
  const Order ({
    required this.id,
    required this.customerName,
    required this.price,
  });

  final int id;
  final String customerName;
  final Price price;
}

enum Currency { usd, cad, ... }

class Price {
  const Price({
    required this.currency,
    required this.dollars,
    required this.cents,
  }): assert(cents < 100);

  final Currency currency;
  final int dollars;
  final int cents;
}
```

When you pass this `Order` type as a parameter to a cloud function or when you return it from a cloud function, 
Celest will automatically serialize and deserialize it for you.

```dart {1,5} filename="celest/lib/src/functions/orders.dart"
import 'package:celest_backend/models/order.dart';

@cloud
Future<String> createOrder(
  Order customerOrder,
) async {
  // Function logic goes here
}
```

Celest does this by inspecting every function marked with `@cloud` to find the data types you've used and any types those types use
and generates a schema for each of them. This schema is then used to serialize and deserialize the data to and from JSON.

For example when passing an order to your backend, Celest will serialize the `Order` class as a JSON map with the field names as keys and
the values marshalled to the appropriate JSON representation.

```json
{
  "customerOrder": {
    "id": 123,
    "customerName": "Celest",
    "price": {
      "currency": "usd",
      "dollars": 100,
      "cents": 34
    }
  }
}
```

Similarly if your Flutter app receives an `Order` object from a Celest Function, Celest knows how to take this JSON and map it back into
the same Dart type. The process happens so transparently that you'll feel like you're just passing Dart objects directly between two 
local functions.

in which your backend runs.
