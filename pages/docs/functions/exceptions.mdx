# Throwing exceptions

Celest also knows how to handle exceptions thrown in your Celest Functions. When an exception is thrown, Celest will do three things:

- Catch the thrown exception serialize it using the same process outlined above
- Map the exception to an appropriate HTTP response and status code
- Deserialize the exception type in your Flutter app and rethrow the same Dart type with the original message

Suppose you have some validation logic on your server which checks that a user's name is properly formatted. If the name is empty, 
you want to throw an exception. You can define a Dart type in your Celest backend to represent this error.

```dart filename="celest/lib/src/exceptions/bad_name_exception.dart"
class BadNameException implements Exception {
  const BadNameException(this.message);

  final String message;
}
```

When you encounter an empty name, you can throw this exception in your Celest Function.

```dart {7} filename="celest/lib/src/functions/greeting.dart"
import 'package:celest_backend/exceptions/bad_name_exception.dart';

@cloud
Future<String> sayHello(String name) async {
  // Perform custom validation
  if (name.isEmpty) {
    throw const BadNameException('Name cannot be empty');
 }
  return 'Hello, $name';
}
```

In your Flutter app, the same `BadNameException` type will be thrown by the generated client so
you can catch it and handle it as you would any other exception. Any `message` you passed in the
on the server will be available in the `message` field of the exception on the client. Magically!

```dart {8-11}
import 'package:celest_backend/client.dart';

@cloud
Future<String> getGreeting(String name) async {
  try {
    return await celest.functions.greeting.sayHello(name);
  // Catch the exception type defined in your backend
  } on BadNameException catch (e) {
    print(e.message); // prints "Name cannot be empty"
    rethrow;
  }
}
```

## HTTP mapping

When an exception is thrown in your Celest Function, Celest will map the exception to an appropriate HTTP response code.
For example, all `Exception` types will be mapped to a `400 Bad Request` status and all `Error` types will be mapped 
to a `500 Internal Server Error` status by default.

Celest also provides a number of built-in exception types for common HTTP status codes. For example, you can throw a `NotFoundException`
to return a `404 Not Found` status code. And you can even include a custom message with it.

```dart
import 'package:celest/celest.dart';

@cloud
Future<String> sayHello(String name) async {
  if (name.isEmpty) {
    throw const NotFoundException('Name cannot be empty');
  }
  return 'Hello, $name';
}
```

If an exception type you've defined needs to be mapped to a different status code, you can use the `@httpError` annotation to 
specify the status code Celest should use for it. For example, maybe we want our `BadNameException` to return a `404 Not Found` status
instead of the default `400`.

```dart
import 'package:celest/celest.dart';
import 'package:celest/http.dart';

class BadNameException implements Exception {
  const BadNameException(this.message);

  final String message;
}

@cloud
@httpError(404, BadNameException)
Future<String> sayHello(String name) async {
  if (name.isEmpty) {
    throw const BadNameException('Name cannot be empty');
  }
  return 'Hello, $name';
}
```
