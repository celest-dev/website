# Defining custom exceptions

You can create custom exception types in your backend to throw specific errors and react to them accordingly in your Flutter app.

## Using custom exceptions

Below is an example of how to define a custom exception. You can create exceptions inside your `celest/lib/exceptions/` folder.

```dart
// celest/lib/exceptions/bad_name_exception.dart

class BadNameException implements Exception {
  const BadNameException(this.message);

  final String message;
}
```

You can then throw these exceptions in your Celest Functions whenever needed as shown below.

```dart {8}
// celest/functions/greeting.dart

import 'package:celest_backend/exceptions/bad_name_exception.dart';

Future<String> sayHello(String name) async {
  // Perform custom validation
  if (name.isEmpty) {
    throw const BadNameException('Name cannot be empty');
 }
  return 'Hello, $name';
}
```

In your Flutter app, the same `BadNameException` type will be thrown by the generated client if an error occurs.

```dart {7-10}
import 'package:celest_backend/client.dart';

Future<String> getGreeting(String name) async {
  try {
    return await celest.functions.greeting.sayHello(name);
  // Catch the exception type defined in your backend
  } on BadNameException catch (e) {
    print('Uh oh! Could not greet $name: $e');
    rethrow;
  }
}
```

## Writing custom serialization logic

Just like [custom model types](/docs/functions/data-types.md#writing-custom-serialization-logic), custom exceptions can define their own serialization logic. This is useful when you have existing types you want to make use of which are not serializable by default.

## Next steps

You have now learned how to create and throw custom exceptions in your Celest Functions. We have additional guides to teach you about [managing environment variables](/docs/functions/env-variables.md) and [creating tests for your functions](/docs/functions/testing.md).
