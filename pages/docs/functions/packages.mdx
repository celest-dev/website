# Using packages

Your Celest backend is a pure Dart application. Any Dart packages which can be used in a Dart app can be used in your functions. For example, to communicate with systems outside of Celest, you could use `package:http`, `package:dio`, or any other HTTP client compatible with pure Dart.

## Adding a Dart package to your backend

To add a package for use in your backend, navigate in your terminal to the `<flutter_app>/celest` folder and then run the `dart pub add <package-name>` command.

```shell
$ dart pub add <package-name>
```
