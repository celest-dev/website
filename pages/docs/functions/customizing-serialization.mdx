# Customizing serialization

If you need custom handling for your serialization logic, either to conform to an existing interface or to ensure parity with other parts
of your application, define the `fromJson` and `toJson` methods to your data type. Celest will use these methods when provided instead of
its default serialization logic.

## Example

Consider the `Price` type that we defined in [Defining your data types](./data-types.mdx).

```dart
enum Currency { usd, cad, ... }

class Price {
  const Price({
    required this.currency,
    required this.dollars,
    required this.cents,
  }): assert(cents < 100);

  final Currency currency;
  final int dollars;
  final int cents;
}
```

By default, Celest follows the conventions of `package:json_serializable` and will serialize the `Price` type as:

```json
{
  "currency": "usd",
  "dollars": 100,
  "cents": 34
}
```

If, however, you want to serialize the `currency` field as uppercase, you can define the `fromJson` and `toJson` methods 
in the `Price` class.

```dart {6-8,15} filename="celest/lib/src/models/price.dart"
class Price {
  // ...

  factory Price.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic> json) {
    return Price(
      currency: Currency.values.firstWhere(
        (e) => e.toString().toUpperCase() == json['currency'],
      ),
      dollars: json['dollars'] as int,
      cents: json['cents'] as int,
    );
  }

  Map<String, dynamic> toJson() => {
      'currency': currency.name.toUpperCase(),
      'dollars': dollars,
      'cents': cents,
    };
}
```

Then, anytime you use the `Price` type in a cloud function, Celest will use this logic for handling
the serialization. And the resulting JSON response for the `currency` will be properly upper-cased.

 ```diff {6,7}
{
  "customerOrder": {
    "id": 123,
    "customerName": "Celest",
    "price": {
+    "currency": "USD",
-    "currency": "usd",
      "dollars": 100,
      "cents": 34
    }
  }
}
```

## Customize serialization of third-party types [#custom-overrides]

Sometimes, though, you cannot control the `fromJson`/`toJson` methods of a class, such as when using a third-party library. 
In these cases, you can create a `@customOverride` which "redefines" the type for serialization in Celest.

For example, consider the case where the `Price` class from our `Order` type is imported from a third-party library, `package:price`. 
Since we do not own `package:price`, we cannot change the `fromJson` and `toJson` methods of the `Price` class.

Instead of modifying the `Price` class, we can define a custom override for `Price` which will be used in place of the original
`Price` class when it's encountered in Celest.

<Callout>
Custom overrides are defined as [extension types](https://dart.dev/language/extension-types) which wrap and implement the original type. 
You can use these to override any part of the original interface to suit its use in your backend, though customizing serialization is the 
most common use case.

You must always **implement** the original type in your extension type and mark it with `@customOverride`. By convention, these types are
defined in either `lib/models/_overrides.dart` or `lib/exceptions/_overrides.dart` and are not used directly in your backend. They serve as
global marker types which Celest will use internally.

```dart {10-11} filename="celest/lib/src/models/_overrides.dart"
import 'package:celest/celest.dart';
import 'package:price/price.dart';

// We create an extension type which wraps over the third-party type and
// is marked as a custom override of it.
//
// You do not need to use this type directly in your backend. Celest will
// use it internally anytime it encounters the original type.
@customOverride
extension type PriceOverride(Price price) implements Price {
  factory PriceOverride.fromJson(Map<String, Object?> json) {
    return PriceOverride(
      Price(
        currency: Currency.values.firstWhere(
          (e) => e.toString().toUpperCase() == json['currency'],
        ),
        dollars: json['dollars'] as int,
        cents: json['cents'] as int,
      ),
    );
  }

  Map<String, Object?> toJson() => {
        'currency': price.currency.toString().toUpperCase(),
        'dollars': price.dollars,
        'cents': price.cents,
      };
}
```
