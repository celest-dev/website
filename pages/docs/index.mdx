# Overview

## What is Celest?

Celest is a backend-as-a-service for Flutter developers that enables you to build your backend entirely in Dart. Build the use cases you need without any additional tooling or context switching to different programming languages. Since you are writing your backend in Dart, Celest enables you to share logic and code between your Flutter app and your backend.

## How do I use Celest?

You primarily interact with Celest using the [Celest CLI](/#download). 

Once you download and install the CLI, run `celest start` from your Flutter project to create your `celest` folder. This will contain all of your backend logic. You can then use the Celest CLI to build your project locally and leverage the code-generated client in your Flutter app to connect to your backend. When you feel confident with your changes, use the CLI to deploy your backend to the cloud.

Celest offers a set of use cases via "Cloud Widgets," constructs that encapsulate groups of functionality. Using these widgets you can declaratively define your backend features such as Authentication, Data, and Storage.
