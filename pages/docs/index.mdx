# Overview

## What is Celest?

Celest is a backend-as-a-service for Flutter developers that enables you to build your backend entirely in Dart. Build the use cases you need without any additional tooling or context switching to different programming languages. Celest lets you write your backend in Dart, enabling you to share logic between your Flutter app and your backend.

## How do I use Celest?

You primarily interact with Celest using the [Celest CLI](/docs/download). 

Once you download and install the CLI, run `celest start` from your Flutter project to create the `celest` folder. This folder contains all of your backend logic. The CLI will watch for changes in this folder and hot-reload your backend as you work. A client library is automatically generated for you in your Flutter app. When you feel confident with your changes, use the CLI to [deploy](/docs/deploy) your backend to the cloud.

Celest offers a set of "Cloud Widgets"&mdash;constructs that encapsulate functionality on the backend. Using these widgets you can declaratively define your backend features such as serverless functions and authentication.
