# Deploying your project

To deploy your Celest project, just run `celest deploy`. That's it! ðŸš€

If this is your first time deploying a project, you'll be asked for your email address to create an account. 
After that, your project will start deploying and you'll start to see the following updates in the terminal.

### Updating your app

Once your project is deployed, you'll need to update your Flutter app to make use of it.

Replace your call to `celest.init` with the new production environment generated for you. Everything
should work the same as the local environment, but you'll be using your Celest Cloud backend.

```dart {6} filename="lib/main.dart"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:celest_backend/client.dart';
 
void main() {
  // Initialize Celest with the production environment
  celest.init(environment: CelestEnvironment.production);
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```
