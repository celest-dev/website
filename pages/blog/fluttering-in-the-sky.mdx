# Fluttering in the sky

<Authors />

Today, we're excited to release version 0.4 of Celest, including support for HTTP customization, improved ergonomics, and a preview of running
Flutter and UI code in the sky!
This release scaffolds the foundation for our vision of Dart and Flutter in the cloud, providing extensibility and interop over the larger
cloud landscape.

Along with this post, we've published a deep dive into how we designed the Celest framework and how we leverage the Dart language to
achieve that. You can read it [here](/blog/how-we-want-to-backend).

<Callout type="info" emoji={<FaRocket className="my-auto h-full mr-1" />}>
When you're ready, just run `celest upgrade` to get started! Or head over to the [download](/docs/download) page if this is your first
time trying Celest.

## HTTP customization

Celest 0.4 introduces a host of new annotations for defining the shape and behavior of your HTTP API. These let you customize everything
from the method and success status code, to how the API responds when a certain error occurs, and mapping parameters to HTTP headers and 
query values.

<div className="md:columns-2 my-4">
<div>
```dart
@cloud
@http(method: HttpMethod.get)
Future<void> greeting({
  @httpQuery('name') required String name,
}) async {
    return 'Hello, $name';
}
```
</div>
<div className="flex flex-col">
<div>
```http
GET /greet?name=Celest
Accept: application/json
```
</div>
<div>
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "response": "Hello, Celest"
}
```
</div>
</div>
</div>

These annotations do not change the generated client interface, so no changes are needed to adopt them in your Flutter app.

Check out the new [HTTP Customization](/docs/functions/http/customization) docs for more details.

## Refined ergonomics

The new release introduces a few breaking changes to improve the ergonomics of the framework. You do not need to worry about migrating your
code, though. The first time you run `celest start` after upgrading, the CLI will automatically migrate your project to these new changes.

Below is an overview of the changes and why we think they'll improve your development experience.

### `@cloud` annotation

Before this release, all public functions in the `functions` directory were deployed to the cloud. This made it difficult to share logic
between files and implicitly deploy functions you didn't intend to.

Starting in the new release, only functions marked with `@cloud` will be deployed to the cloud. This is to ensure that only the
functions you intend to deploy are deployed, and to allow you to more easily share logic between files in your project.

<div className="md:columns-2 my-4">
<div>
<div className="font-bold text-center">Before</div>
```dart
// Not deployed to the cloud
String _getGreeting(String name) {
  return 'Hello, $name';
}

// Deployed to the cloud
Future<String> sayHello(String name) async {
  return _getGreeting(name);
}
```
</div>
<div>
<div className="font-bold text-center">After</div>
```dart
// Not deployed to the cloud
String getGreeting(String name) {
  return 'Hello, $name';
}

// Deployed to the cloud
@cloud
Future<String> sayHello(String name) async {
  return getGreeting(name);
}
```
</div>
</div>

### Injecting user information

Before this release, functions marked `@authenticated` or `@public` could access the calling `User` information by tagging a parameter with
`@Context.user`.

In the new release, we've replaced the `@Context.user` annotation with `@principal`. This annotation will be reused in future updates
to allow accessing information about non-`User` callers, such as service accounts and third-party entities.

<div className="md:columns-2 my-4">
<div>
<div className="font-bold text-center">Before</div>
```dart {2}
Future<String> sayHello({
  @Context.user required User user,
}) async {
  return 'Hello, ${user.displayName}';
}
```
</div>
<div>
<div className="font-bold text-center">After</div>
```dart {2}
Future<String> sayHello({
  @principal required User user,
}) async {
  return 'Hello, ${user.displayName}';
}
```
</div>
</div>

### Accessing environment variables

Before this release, you could access environment variables using the generated `@Env` type.

In this release, we've renamed `@Env` to `@env`. Going forward, all annotations will be lowercase to reduce the visual
clutter associated with annotations and allow you to better distinguish the concrete interface of your APIs from its metadata.

<div className="md:columns-2 my-4">
<div>
<div className="font-bold text-center">Before</div>
```dart {3}
Future<String> sayHello({
  required String name,
  @Env.apiKey required String apiKey,
}) async {
  // Call an external API with `apiKey`
}
```
</div>
<div>
<div className="font-bold text-center">After</div>
```dart {3}
Future<String> sayHello({
  required String name,
  @env.apiKey required String apiKey,
}) async {
  // Call an external API with `apiKey`
}
```
</div>
</div>

## Flutter in the sky

Last but not least, we're excited to announce a preview of running Flutter and UI code in the cloud! 

<Callout>
This feature is currently **experimental** and may change in future releases. We're excited to see what you build with it and would love
to hear your feedback!
</Callout>

For the longest time, Dart backends have been limited by one major constraint: they can't use Flutter or any package that depends on it.
If you've ever seen the following trying to compile a Dart backend, you know what we're talking about:

```dart filename="main.dart"
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  const favoriteColor = Colors.green;
  print('My favorite color is $favoriteColor');
}
```

```bash
$ dart main.dart

../../flutter/packages/flutter/lib/src/material/animated_icons.dart:9:8: Error: Dart library 'dart:ui' is not available on this platform.
import 'dart:ui' as ui show Canvas, Paint, Path, lerpDouble;
       ^
Context: The unavailable library 'dart:ui' is imported through these packages:

    dart_ui_test.dart => package:flutter => dart:ui
    ...

Detailed import paths for (some of) the these imports:

    dart_ui_test.dart => package:flutter/material.dart => package:flutter/src/material/about.dart => package:flutter/foundation.dart => package:flutter/src/foundation/assertions.dart => package:flutter/src/foundation/diagnostics.dart => dart:ui
    ...
```

This is a major pain because so many of the amazing packages in the Dart ecosystem depend on Flutter or `dart:ui`. And if you
simply need a data type or utility from these packages (or if any one of your transitive dependencies does) you're out of luck.

It turns out that solving this problem requires the same amount of work as bringing all of Flutter to the cloud. So we did that.


<div className="md:columns-2 my-4">
<div>
```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

import 'package:celest/celest.dart';
import 'package:celest/http.dart';

@cloud
@http(method: HttpMethod.get)
Future<Color> myFavoriteColor() async {
  return Colors.green;
}
```
</div>
<div className="flex flex-col">
<div>
```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "response": {
    "value": 4283215696
  }
}
```
</div>
</div>
</div>

With Celest 0.4, all of Flutter is available to your Dart backend, and you can use it just like you would in a Flutter app.
Under the hood, we use the same technology that powers `flutter test` so this is a good mental model for how it can be used:
automating screenshots, running integration tests, or even rendering `Image` widgets!

At the moment, this technology is still experimental and we're working on improving the ergonomics and performance of the feature.
We hope you'll give it a try, find cool use cases, and let us know how we can improve it!

## What's next?

This release sets the foundation for our vision of Dart and Flutter in the cloud. The HTTP customization and refined ergonomics
will be extended to support webhooks, scheduled tasks, and event streaming in future releases.

And our work with Flutter in the cloud is just beginning. Our goal is to bring full server-side rendering capabilities to Flutter,
including the ability to send dynamic widgets to the client

Lastly, we're working to expand the Auth category to include social sign-in and passwordless support; and to share our solution for 
building offline-first applications the Flutter way.

Over the next few months, you'll see more work on all of these fronts along with continued improvements to the core framework. We're
excited to see what you build with Celest 0.4. Let us know your thoughts on [GitHub](https://github.com/celest-dev/celest), [X](https://x.com/celest_dev), and [Discord](/discord)!

Flutter is the future! ðŸš€
