# How we want to backend

<Authors />

Today, we're excited to release version 0.4 of Celest, including support for HTTP customization, improved ergonomics, and a preview of running
Flutter and UI code in the sky! We've published a separate [blog](/blog/fluttering-in-the-sky) post to discuss all the
new features. In this post, we want to dive into more of the design of Celest and the principles that guide it.

As you build with Celest, you'll notice that it requires a slightly different way of thinking about your backend. 
This article walks through how we arrived at the design of Celest and what we're trying to achieve.

The first thing you'll notice is Celest's liberal usage of Dart [annotations](https://dart.dev/language/metadata). 
Annotations are used in Celest to convey almost all the metadata and semantics of your backend.

```dart
@cloud
@authenticated
Future<String> sayHello({
  @principal required User user,
}) async {
  return 'Hello, ${user.displayName}';
}
```

At first glance, this syntax can seem cumbersome and you may wonder why this design decision was made.

Our goals for Celest are two-fold:
1. To have you write the least amount of boilerplate code possible, letting us do the heavy lifting; and
2. To let you convey the semantics of your backend precisely and unambiguously.

Annotations allow us to achieve both these goals, _if_ we do it right.

> And if we ever don't, please let us know! API design and naming can be especially tricky to get right, 
> and we're by no means perfect.

## Declarative backends

The first thing annotations do is enable you to think about your backend declaratively. Instead of telling 
Celest how to do something, you tell Celest what you want to do and let it figure out the best way possible.

For example, instead of writing code to set up an HTTP server, you annotate your logic with `@cloud`.

```dart
@cloud
Future<String> sayHello() async {
  return 'Hello, world!';
}
```

Instead of writing code to handle authentication via middleware or a proxy, you label your protected logic 
with `@authenticated`.

```dart
@cloud
@authenticated
Future<String> sayHello() async {
  return 'Hello, valued customer!';
}
```

Celest has built-in opinions on how to handle each of these cases which optimize the performance and security of your backend.
In the cases where you know better than us, we expose additional annotations to override our defaults (e.g. with 
[HTTP customizations](/docs/functions/http/customization)) while stll minimizing the boilerplate.

Either way, Celest allows you to convey the _intent_ of how some code should work without worrying about 
exactly _how_ it is done unless you want to.

### Sane defaults

Being so opinionated means that if we have the wrong opinions, you'll end up writing customizations for everything you're building,
completely defeating our sole mission. To avoid this, we've tried to make our default behavior _sane_.

Sane default behavior means that the "magic" Celest does is what you probably would have done anyway. It's what your intuition would suggest is
happening. And it has baked in the current best practices around design and security.

Let's take `@authenticated` as an example. When you see a function labeled as such, you would expect that only users who have passed through a login
flow, and have a valid login session, can access it. You would intuit this information is being conveyed via some HTTP header like `Authorization`. And
best practices would suggest that any function _not_ labeled as `@authenticated` be deny-by-default.

All of this is true for `@authenticated` and these are the ways we try to reason about every annotation.

## Infrastructure from code

When it comes time to deploy that backend, the current trend is to write your infrastructure as code (the IaC paradigm) in order to have declarative,
reproducible, and auditable deployments. To do this, you would typically introduce a new codebase to store your infrastructure which lives alongside your backend. 

For example, you may have a backend written in Node.js and scaffold out your infrastructure in Terraform.

<Bleed>
<div className="flex flex-row flex-wrap items-center justify-center">
<div className="px-2">
```js filename="index.js"
export function handler(event, context) {
  console.log("Got event:", event);
};
```
</div>
<div className="px-2">
```hcl filename="main.tf"
resource "aws_lambda_function" "example" {
  function_name = "example"
  handler = "index.handler"
  runtime = "nodejs14.x"
  role = aws_iam_role.example.arn
}
```
</div>
</div>
<p className="mt-2 text-sm text-gray-400 text-center">An example Node.js Lambda function and the Terraform to deploy it.</p>
</Bleed>

Much like Celest, this allows you to _declare_ the components of your infrastructure instead of imperatively creating, updating, and deleting
them by hand. And for a while, it works great!

The split of backend and infrastructure logic creates fragmentation in your codebase, though. As your project scales, some hairy issues start to emerge:

- Features must be written and coordinated twice: once in the backend and again for the corresponding infrastructure.
- The infrastructure code can become out-of-date with the backend code, leading to bugs and security vulnerabilities.
- Understanding the infrastructure that controls a piece of backend code requires jumping between two, possibly distinct, codebases.

At Celest, we've experienced all these problems and more. And through that pain, we've come to believe that the best way to write infrastructure is to 
write it _alongside_ the code it manages. Ideally, everything relevant to a piece of backend code should live right next to it
in the same file, function, and language.

> This paradigm has been coined infrastructure-**from**-code (IfC), as opposed to the 
> infrastructure-as-code pattern described previously.

```dart
@cloud
@authenticated
Future<String> sayHello() async {
  return 'Hello, valued customer!';
}
```

Adopting this paradigm, you need only look at the function itself to understand both its logic and its infrastructure. 
No other files, languages, or teams are required. 

On the surface, it may seem that this leads to more friction when trying to understand any piece of backend code. But because there still exists 
a clean separation of your backend and infrastructure (i.e. runtime vs. static code), you can safely ignore one or the other to process each part in isolation.

And whenever you need to update a part of your backend, you can do so in a single place.

We think that's powerful!

## Blurring the lines even more

But why stop there? What if you could not only keep your backend and infrastructure code together but also your client code?

Currently, in Celest, everything must be done in a separate `celest` folder which lives outside your client app. Your backend types and logic are all
separate from your client code and, because they live in a separate Dart package, you must follow Dart package conventions to share them with your frontend. 

For example, Celest requires that all your shared code live in the `lib` folder of your Celest project. But this, too, can create friction when you're
working on a piece of frontend code and realize you need to update the backend.

Imagine you're working on this Dart application and decide you want the `sayHello` function to run only in the backend.

```dart
Future<String> sayHello() async {
  return 'Hello, world!';
}

void main() async {
  print(await sayHello());
}
```

You would have to move the function to your Celest project, import the generated client into your frontend project, and update your frontend to call the Celest client. 
Hopefully, it all goes as planned.

What if, instead, you could just do this?

```dart {1}
@cloud
Future<String> sayHello() async {
  return 'Hello, world!';
}

void main() async {
  print(await sayHello());
}
```

That's how we want to backend. Over the next few months, you'll see more work to blur these lines with IDE plugins, better Dart analyzer support, and macros ðŸ‘€. To learn
