00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.640
Developers are using Flutter to build

00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:05.040
cross-platform applications to quickly
reach users on any device,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.680
but when it comes to building the back
end, their time is spent switching between

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:11.340
different programing
languages and toolchains.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.080
Introducing Celest. Celest is a service

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.620
that turns every Flutter developer
into a full-stack developer.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.320
To start using Celest in your Flutter

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.540
project, just run `celest start`,
add your project name, and voila!

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.120
Your Celest backend is
created and ready to go.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.160
In the Celest folder,
you create the APIs your app needs as

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.960
top level Dart functions,
and when you hit save,

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.340
the Celest CLI detects the change
and hot reloads your backend.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.880
In your Flutter app, you use the generated
client from Celest to connect to your

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.160
backend, and when you are confident
with your changes, just run `celest deploy`,

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.500
and your backend is
deployed and managed for you.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.900
With Celest, no more context switching.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.540
You write every part of your Flutter
app in Dart, right in your IDE.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.080
