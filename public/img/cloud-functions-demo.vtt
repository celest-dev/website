00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
Let's create a Celest Function!

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.050
Start by running `celest start`
from your Flutter app.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.490
Then choose a name for your project.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.810
And in just a few seconds, you've got
a Celest backend generated for you.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.210
To add a new cloud function,

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.850
navigate to the "functions"
folder and choose an API file.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.730
Give your function a name and write it
like you would any other Dart function.

00:00:20.763 --> 00:00:23.914
Next, import the generated
Flutter client and call `celest.init()`

00:00:23.947 --> 00:00:26.957
at the start of your app.

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.610
The client is strongly typed

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.320
and matches the names of your
cloud functions in your backend.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.640
And Celest handles the serialization for you,

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.610
so you can just focus
on writing your logic.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.410
That's right!
No more JSON serializable.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.240
