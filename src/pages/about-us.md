## Who We Are

Celest is a managed cloud platform for Flutter and Dart developers. We are introducing "Cloud Widgets", a set of primitives which enable developers to use Dart for every piece of their backend and infrastructure.

We are a Y Combinator-backed company, and we are rapidly building to become the preferred choice of Flutter and Dart developers needing a holistic backend solution.

## Our Mission

Our sole passion is Dart and Flutter. We champion the Dart ethos of _run on all platforms_. Following in the footsteps of Flutter's strides in cross-platform app development, our goal is to extend this wildly successful model to the backend and create an integrated developer experience that leverages Dart's full potential.

## Our Story

Founded by Dillon Nys and Abdallah Shaban, both former members of the AWS Amplify Flutter team, Celest emerged from a clear and pressing need in the Flutter community. As Dart's popularity has surged, developers are seeking a backend solution that mirrors Flutter's exceptional developer experience. This need inspires us to build Celest.

## Our Tenets

1. **We focus on foundations**

   A strong foundation leads to a proper structure. We focus on the primitives of our services and optimize them to perfection. We build products that seamlessly compose so that when new feature requests come, we are well-equipped to deliver them.

2. **We dog-food our products**

   As both a consumer and supplier of infrastructure products, we are the first to incorporate new features into our production workload. We carry the highest expectations of our products.

3. **We are not afraid to innovate**

   We prioritize developer experience above all else. If a product exists which provides the experience we want, we use it. When it doesn’t, we build it.

4. **We involve our customers**

   In every step of the journey, we seek customer feedback and involvement. We build in public. We build with them and for them.

5. **We are constantly seeking out the “next big thing”**

   Technology changes at a break-neck pace and we must stay alert to all the developments in our space and adjacent ones. We are constantly experimenting and trying to anticipate where the market is going and what our customers will be asking for in 6 months, even if it’s not directly in our wheelhouse.

6. **We follow the beat of our own drum**

   We believe our product must stand on its own and be great on its own. We focus on building for our users and only loosely keep a pulse on our competitors.

7. **We work backwards from the customer**

   Every feature is born from a customer pain point or intense desire. We start with the why and reverse engineer the experience that will delight them.

8. **We test our products**

   We are a software company. Our code is our honor and it must work as advertised—no exceptions. If a behavior is expected or anticipated from our product, we have an automated test for it. In that way, our tests bind us to a contract with our customers. There are no guessing games.

9. **We lead with respect and candor**

   We value respect and honesty above anyone’s ego. We believe that by living in truth, we achieve the greatest product, community, and company together.

10. **We serve one another**

    When someone needs help, we drop everything. When something is broken, we fix it. We are a team united in our mission. We are not above any task and we do the hard parts so others don’t have to—for our customers and for each other. We make peoples’ day.
