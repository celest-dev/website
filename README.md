# Website

The home of [Celest's](https://celest.dev) Website, the Flutter cloud platform.

## Development

This website is built using [Docusaurus 3](https://docusaurus.io/). To contribute, you will need to install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

### Setup

Start by cloning the repository and installing its dependencies.

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/celest-dev/website
$ cd website
$ pnpm install
```

### Local Development

To start a local development server, run `pnpm start`. Most changes will be reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

To build the website for production, run `pnpm build`. This command generates static content into the `build` directory.

To view the production build locally, run `pnpm serve`.
